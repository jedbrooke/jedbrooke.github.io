## Here's some stuff that I made

#### Coming soon:
1. [CUDA JPEG compressor](https://github.com/jedbrooke/toojpeg)<br>
A fork of [stbrumme/toojpeg](https://github.com/stbrumme/toojpeg), adding CUDA acceleration to a simple jpeg compressor.
2. Auto trace Blender Add-on<br>
Coming soon. The idea is to make something like the Auto-Trace feature in Adobe After Effect, but to create verticies instead of masks.
3. Probably some other stuff<br>
Yeah programs!
